# COIN
Java code for COIN VASSAL extensions to interface with a bot script.

See:
https://github.com/bdgza/ADPBot
https://github.com/autonm/FS

### Dependencies

Requires JSON Simple: https://github.com/fangyidong/json-simple

### Java

These classes use the Java ScriptEngine for JavaScript available from Java SE 7 or later. This means these classes are not compatible with all versions of Java supported by VASSAL.

### VASSAL

Some code has been taken from the VASSAL project and modified. The NoteWindow was taken as a base for the AI windows, to add a toolbar button to the VASSAL interface. Other classes are used unmodified.

VASSAL is released under LGPL v2.1 or newer.
